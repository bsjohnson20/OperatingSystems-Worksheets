## How to Play TicTacToe?

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Player 1 is`X` and Player 2 is`O`.
3. Players take turns placing their marks in empty squares.
4. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
5. If all 9 squares are filled and neither player has 3 in a row, the game is a draw.

```sh
g++ tictactoe.cpp -o a.out
./a.out
```

Enjoy the game!
